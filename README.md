The Memory Match Game is a Python project built using Tkinter. It displays 16 cards with 8 matching pairs. Players flip two cards at a time to find a match. Matching cards stay open, while non-matching cards flip back. The game continues until all pairs are found. It is a simple and fun way to practice memory skills.
